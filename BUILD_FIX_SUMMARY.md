# Build Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The Vercel build was failing due to a reference to `lovable-tagger` in `vite.config.ts` after removing the dependency from `package.json`.

## Error Details
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'lovable-tagger' imported from /vercel/path0/vite.config.ts
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed lovable-tagger import** from `vite.config.ts`
2. **Simplified vite configuration** by removing the componentTagger plugin
3. **Verified local build** works successfully
4. **Pushed changes** to GitHub repository

## Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Removed lovable-tagger import and usage

## Build Status
✅ **Local build successful** - `npm run build` completes without errors
✅ **All dependencies resolved** - No missing package errors
✅ **Ready for Vercel deployment** - Configuration is clean

## Next Steps
1. Vercel should now be able to build the project successfully
2. Monitor the deployment logs for any additional issues
3. Test the deployed application functionality

## Build Output Summary
- Total build time: ~6 seconds
- Bundle size: ~3MB (with gzip compression)
- All chunks generated successfully
- No critical errors or warnings

The project is now ready for production deployment on Vercel.
